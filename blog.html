                intro
              </h4>
              <p>
                Meditations is written around 170BCE by Marcus Aurelius.<br>
                Marcus Aurelius was born 121 BCE and would eventually become emperor. 
                The Rise of Aurelius would be when he lost his biological father and was 
                adopted by the former emperor, now his adoptive father Aurelius Antonius. 
                As he proclaimed himself, he was  
                <cite><a href="https://www.saxo.com/dk/meditations_emperor-of-rome-marcus-aurelius_paperback_9780140449334?gclid=CjwKCAjwov6hBhBsEiwAvrvN6LRzVcJZWIJHL6sBIBWYExp9I7ifmuz65hnX_XsEYT5Ypwlzu-Ym8RoCyaMQAvD_BwE">
                <i>a male, mature in years, a statesman, a Roman, a ruler (p.11)</i></a></cite>.  
                <br>
                He is now known for being a stoic philosopher, some would say a 
                coincidence because he never published any of his works and was first found 
                after his death 180 BCE. People would make an argument that these works never 
                were intended for publishing, because of the way Meditations is written with an inward tone, 
                but never the less, readable to the next person. Meditations is written as 
                journal entries, these journal entries would be categorized into books, which 
                I interpret as chapters and covers hard/abstract/broad philosophical questions. 
                <br>
                The stoic way of keeping up with their values is by repetition and may be the 
                reason why Meditations came to be, as Meditations could be Marcus Aureliusâ€™ 
                pond to which he could fish whenever he needed to remind himself of his values.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Summary
              </h4>
              <p>
                It is hard to clearly define a summary because of the incoherent style of writing, 
                where each paragraph can be read on its own. Especially the first chapter was 
                captivating/inspiring because of the way he portrays all the inspiring characters 
                in his life and how they formed Marcus to be the person he is. Here he lists philosophers, 
                family members, friends, and gods. In the rest of the chapters he dives deep into his 
                moral/ethical/personal position and at times repeats these positions through different 
                analogies/small stories.
              </p>
              
              <h4>
                My Critique 
              </h4>
              <p>
                I found the book to be a hard read, but that may be the result of my limited vocabulary as well as me not 
                being used to reading. Because of this, I had to look up words frequently which interrupted my flow in reading. 
                Meditations went deep in explaining analogies and would sometimes lead to confusion about what was meant and 
                forgetting the context in which he tried to prove a point. But I think it is important to remember again that 
                the intention behind Meditations is to be a reminder to himself and was not supposed to satisfy other than himself. 
                <br> 
                On the other hand, when the points are understood, it would lead to satisfying conclusions and a good understanding of 
                his values and ideas. I liked that he tried to be as concise and precise as possible, and didn't feel like he 
                overcomplicated otherwise difficult topics, e.g. death. I think that this book gives a good example of how the stoic 
                interface is applied by a real human being and felt like there was a lot of wisdom in his outlook on life. I liked that 
                the book was short in the sense that I was not overwhelmed and motivated throughout the whole book. I specifically liked 
                this version of Meditations because it provided a good amount of introductory knowledge on Marcus and the era he was living in. 
                Even when the books ended the authors would give context to each paragraph and their interpretation of the matter about the subject.
              </p>
              <h4>
                My Recomendation 
              </h4>
              <p>
                I would gladly recommend Meditations if you are interested in stoicism, and philosophy in general because stoicism has a big impact on 
                Western belives. The book is a quick read and you can dive deep into the book from any given point, beacause of the structure.  
              </p>
              <h4>
                My Rating
              </h4>
              <p>
                I would rate this book a 4/5, because of the deep explanation of analogies/ideas. The reason for not rating the book a 5 is because I 
                think Marcus could provide further information and more comprehensive reason for why he liked Epictetus and his works. 
                <br>

                  Say to yourself first thing in the morning: today I shall mees people who are meddling, ungrateful, 
                  aggressive, treacherous. malicious, unsocial. All this has afflicted them through their ignorance of 
                  true good and evil. But I have seen that the nature of good is what is right, and the nature of 
                  evil what is wrong: and I have reflected that the nature of the offender himself is akin to my own 
                  - not a kinship of blood or seed, but a sharing in the same mind, the same fragment of divinity. 
                  Therefore I cannot be harmed by any of them, as none will infect me with their wrong. Nor can I be 
                  angry with my kinsman or hate him. We were born for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, 
                  like the rows of upper and lower teeth. So to work in opposition to one another is against nature: 
                  and anger or rejection is opposition.
